<!--
Every organization, given enough time and success, develops a beer belly. Not literally, of course — but structurally. Layers of middle management accumulate. Processes designed for coordination become ends in themselves. The distance between the people making decisions and the people doing the work grows wider, and the midsection of the org chart expands to fill it.

I call this the Beer-Belly Organization, and if you've worked in any company north of 500 people, you've seen it.

## How the belly grows

<!--
It starts innocently enough. A team ships something important. The company grows. New people join, and the original team can't manage everything directly anymore. So you add a layer — a director here, a program manager there. Perfectly reasonable.

But then that layer needs coordination too. And the people doing the coordination need their own meetings, their own status updates, their own frameworks for prioritization. Before long, you have an entire stratum of the organization whose primary job is to manage the complexity created by... the previous stratum.

> The most dangerous kind of organizational debt isn't technical — it's structural. It compounds silently, and by the time you notice, the interest payments are enormous.

## The symptoms

<!--
You can diagnose a beer-belly organization by a few reliable signals:

1. **Meeting-to-making ratio skews heavily toward meetings.** Individual contributors spend more time reporting on work than doing it.
2. **Decisions travel upward, then sideways, then back down.** What should be a direct conversation between two teams becomes a multi-week escalation chain.
3. **Strategy becomes indistinguishable from planning.** The organization produces beautiful decks about what it intends to do, but the gap between intention and execution grows every quarter.
4. **New hires in the middle outnumber new hires at the edges.** You're adding program managers faster than you're adding engineers, designers, or customer-facing staff.
5. **"Alignment" becomes a full-time job.** When getting people on the same page requires dedicated headcount, something has gone wrong.

Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod. Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur et:

1. **Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.** Donec sed odio dui. Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper.
2. **Maecenas sed diam eget risus varius blandit sit amet non magna.** Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue.
3. **Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo.** Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.
4. **Fusce dapibus, tellus ac cursus commodo.** Tortor mauris condimentum nibh, ut fermentum massa justo sit amet risus.
5. **Donec ullamcorper nulla non metus auctor fringilla.** Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros.

## Why it's hard to fix

<!--
The beer-belly organization is resilient because the people in the middle are often talented, well-intentioned, and genuinely busy. They're not dead weight — they're load-bearing walls in a building that was designed wrong. Removing them without redesigning the structure just makes things collapse faster.

This is why reorganizations so often fail. They move boxes on an org chart without addressing the underlying dynamics that created the bloat. Six months later, the belly grows back.

Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus dolor auctor. Cras justo odio, dapibus ut facilisis in, egestas eget quam. Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros.

Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur et. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue.

## A different approach

<!--
The alternative isn't to eliminate middle management. It's to change what middle management does. The best organizations I've seen treat the middle layer not as a coordination layer but as a *context* layer. Their job isn't to pass information up and down — it's to ensure that the people doing the work have enough context to make good decisions on their own.

This requires three things:

- **Radical transparency about strategy.** Not quarterly town halls — real, ongoing visibility into what the company is trying to achieve and why.
- **Decision rights pushed to the edges.** If a team needs permission to ship, you have a structural problem. Permission should be the default; escalation should be the exception.
- **Measurement oriented toward outcomes, not activity.** The moment you start measuring how many meetings happened or how many status updates were sent, you've incentivized the belly to grow.
-->

Integer posuere erat a ante venenatis dapibus posuere velit aliquet. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit:

- **Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.** Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum.
- **Maecenas faucibus mollis interdum.** Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.
- **Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus.** Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

## The fitness test

<!--
Here's a simple diagnostic: pick any important initiative in your company. Count the number of people involved who neither *created the strategy* nor *will execute the work*. That number is your organizational BMI. If it's higher than the number of people actually doing the thing, you have a beer belly.

The good news is that organizational fitness, like physical fitness, is recoverable. It just requires honesty about the current state, willingness to make uncomfortable changes, and the discipline to maintain them over time.

The bad news is that most organizations would rather buy a bigger belt.

Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Fusce dapibus, tellus ac cursus commodo, tortor mauris condimentum nibh, ut fermentum massa justo sit amet risus. Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod.

Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Donec sed odio dui. Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper.
