I recently consulted with a company whose prior total annual expenditure on SEO, including software subscriptions, was under $10k - well under 1% of their marketing budget. I was asked to help evaluate GEO vendors the executives spoke with at a conference and to determine what other partners they should look at. The budget was 25x of that previous SEO budget.

I asked for context - what their goals and expectations were, why now, and what conversations they had with those vendors. Then I met with the GEO-specific vendors - analytics platforms and consultants - and I got a familiar feeling that I'd experienced this before. Heavy on time pressure, proprietary metrics, and implicit promises. Light on specifics and pretty critical questions. I was reminded of the SEO industry from the 2000s. Maybe with a little more polish that comes with VC/PE money.

The SEO space in those years, mid to late 2000s, was the wild west. Information asymmetry between sellers and buyers reigned, metrics were easily gamed, and the delay between contract signature and results means that companies were out a good bit of cash before they realized that they made a mistake. To some extent, the SEO space would clean itself up (again, somewhat), shifting from directory submissions and keyword stuffing to link building to content marketing to authority building. However, the grifters made money, companies wasted time (and said money), and there is still somewhat of a gray cloud over it today.<sup class="cite-ref" data-ref="1" id="ref-1-back"><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>

So what can we apply from those early days of SEO to what we're seeing in the emerging marketing place for GEO products and services today? Is GEO fundamentally different and should we expect better (or worse) or is this just the next cycle of the SEO grift getting help with cover from some brand new acronym and the next cycle of information asymmetry getting a rebrand?

## Key Points

- **Companies that weren't investing significantly in SEO are opening their checkbooks for GEO.** The FOMO is real, executives are being bombarded from every angle with urgency about AI-driven discovery, often by the same wave of consultants and vendors has materialized overnight to meet that anxiety with expensive solutions.

- **There are parallels to the early days of SEO** - proprietary and opaque metrics that don't cleanly connect to business value, vendors selling urgency over evidence, and a buyer market that lacks the baseline knowledge to evaluate what's being sold.

- **However, SEO eventually (sort of) professionalized because of structural conditions that don't exist in the GEO space and show no clear path to emerging.** SEO had one dominant platform, deterministic-ish outputs, roughly aligned incentives between platform and practitioners, and slow enough change cycles for real expertise to develop.

- **The measurement problem is even harder than the tooling problem.**<sup class="cite-ref" data-ref="2" id="ref-2-back"><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> GEO-specific tools face structurally harder challenges than early SEO tools did, but the real bottleneck is whether organizations can sustain investment and build processes long enough to see measurable value.

- **LLMs don't create new demand even though they redistribute how existing demand gets routed.** That redistribution matters, but it doesn't justify the gold rush. Unless you're a major publisher negotiating direct licensing deals with LLM providers, the case for aggressive first-mover investment is weak.

- **The list of things you should be doing differently because of GEO is short.** Most of what's being sold as GEO is repackaged SEO, answer engine optimization, content best practices, PR, and brand/reputation management.

- **None of this is an argument that AI-driven discovery doesn't matter.** It does today and will matter more over time. But many companies investing heavily in GEO-specific efforts will be disappointed by the results they're able to show for it.

- **The best GEO strategy is the SEO, content, and brand strategy you should have already been executing.** Focus on the fundamentals that many organizations have been underinvesting in that have value across search, LLM discovery, and brand simultaneously. Keep GEO and SEO efforts unified in tooling and teams, avoid vendor lock-in, and keep GEO-specific investment and expectations modest until the landscape stabilizes.
