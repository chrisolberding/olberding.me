description: "An introduction to empathetic transactionalism: a mental model for the manager/report relationship that is honest about the exchange without treating it as the whole of what the relationship requires."
---

The employment relationship is one of the more unusual arrangements in modern life. Two parties enter into it with different kinds of stake in the outcome, different information about each other, and expectations that are only partially made explicit. The formal contract covers compensation and basic obligations. Everything else (how much the manager invests in the report's development, what loyalty means to either side, what happens when business needs and individual interests diverge) is negotiated implicitly and traversed informally.

I've spent a fair amount of time thinking about how to conceptualize that relationship. Treat it as purely transactional and you get a relationship that is honest about the exchange but tends to be narrow and cold. Treat it as something closer to a friendship or a shared project and you get warmth in the short term and confusion when the structural realities of employment eventually assert themselves, which they tend to do.

Neither of these feels adequate as an operating principle, and the existing frameworks each leave a gap. What follows is an attempt to articulate a more coherent frame: what is this relationship, what does each party actually owe the other, and what does that mean in practice?

<div class="key-points">

## Key Points

- **The employment relationship is transactional. Naming that honestly is productive, not cynical.** It clarifies what both parties are actually committed to, which is the precondition for a functional implicit contract. The manager who obscures this under more comfortable language is in a worse position to honor what the relationship requires.

- **Existing management frameworks each capture something real, but none addresses what the manager owes the individual.** Psychological contract theory is descriptive without being normative. Transformational leadership requires authentic belief most managers don't have. Servant leadership dissolves structural asymmetries. The sports team model says little about what happens after a player leaves the roster.

- **The "family" framing is particularly damaging.** It implies unconditional regard and permanence that employment cannot honestly support, generating confusion about authority and creating emotional weight around departures that shouldn't carry it.

- **Empathetic transactionalism adds a forward-looking obligation.** If a report leaves the organization less marketable than they arrived (skills atrophied, kept in a contracting lane, shielded from developmental work), that is a failure of the exchange on the manager's side. The report gave their time; the manager is obligated to ensure that time was an asset to their professional life going forward.

- **ET is a mental model, not a management system.** It doesn't prescribe techniques. It answers a prior question: what is this relationship, and what does that mean about who I am in it? A clear sense of what you owe someone, and why, tends to outlast any framework.

- **The principle does not depend on inspiration or shared mission.** A manager can operate from empathetic transactionalism in a role they took for practical reasons, in an organizational context they're uncertain about. It depends on honesty and on taking the other person's trajectory seriously as a real obligation.

## What the Literature Gets Right, and Where It Falls Short

The academic and practitioner literature on management relationships addresses adjacent questions. Each framework captures something real. None fully addresses the prior question of what the manager owes the individual on the other side of the relationship.

### Psychological Contract Theory

Psychological contract theory, developed primarily by Denise Rousseau in the late 1980s and 1990s,<sup class="cite-ref" data-ref="1" id="ref-1-back"><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> is the most directly relevant framework. Rousseau's central insight is that beyond the formal employment contract there exists a set of implicit mutual expectations (what each party believes the other has committed to) and that violations of this implicit contract produce more damage to the relationship than violations of the formal one. It focuses attention on expectations rather than behaviors, and on the relational rather than the purely transactional dimension of employment.

The limitation is that psychological contract theory is primarily descriptive. It explains why employment relationships break down without providing much normative guidance about what the implicit contract should contain. Two managers can both be operating with coherent psychological contracts (one that promises development and honest communication, another that promises only stability and fair compensation) and the framework treats them equivalently. It tells you what happens when contracts are violated, not what the contract should commit to in the first place.

### Transactional Versus Transformational Leadership

The transactional versus transformational distinction, which runs through much of the post-1980s leadership literature,<sup class="cite-ref" data-ref="2" id="ref-2-back"><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> addresses a related but different question. Transactional leadership operates through explicit exchange (performance for reward) while transformational leadership attempts to elevate both parties through shared vision and intrinsic motivation. The research generally favors transformational approaches on engagement and performance outcomes,<sup class="cite-ref" data-ref="3" id="ref-3-back"><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> and the intuition is sound enough: people who actually believe in what they're doing tend to do it better.

The problem is the word actually. Transformational leadership requires authentic belief in a shared mission, and a generation of managers absorbed the idea that inspiration was a competency they could develop rather than a condition that either existed or didn't. The result has been a lot of managers performing vision (adopting the vocabulary, the town halls, the stated purpose) without the underlying conviction that would make any of it land. A manager who believes in what they're building can lead transformationally and it works. A manager who has been told that this is what good leadership looks like, and who is trying to execute it in a mid-sized company selling financial products or running a marketing department, tends to come off as hollow in ways that are immediately legible to the people reporting to them. Disillusioned staff is a predictable output of performed inspiration.<sup class="cite-ref" data-ref="4" id="ref-4-back"><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> Plain transactional management, whatever its limitations, at least doesn't insult anyone's intelligence.

The deeper limitation is that transformational leadership, even when it works, frames the manager's obligation to the report primarily in terms of the mission: what you owe each other in service of the shared goal. What the manager owes the report as an individual, with a career and a life that extends beyond the current role, is largely outside the frame.

### Servant Leadership

Servant leadership, in the tradition Greenleaf articulated in the 1970s,<sup class="cite-ref" data-ref="5" id="ref-5-back"><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> sits at an extreme that has produced a genuine tradition of thoughtful practice but also a significant amount of the "family" mythology that creates real problems in management. The idea that the leader's primary function is to serve the team is not wrong, but it tends to dissolve the structural asymmetries of the employment relationship in ways that generate confusion about authority, accountability, and what happens when business needs conflict with individual ones.

The family framing is particularly problematic because it implies unconditional regard and permanence that employment relationships cannot honestly support. When an employee leaves a family-framed organization, the departure carries emotional weight it shouldn't (either the employee feels they are abandoning something, or the manager experiences it as a kind of betrayal). These are category errors produced by a metaphor that was wrong from the start.

### The Sports Team Model

The most prominent recent alternative is Reid Hoffman's sports team metaphor,<sup class="cite-ref" data-ref="6" id="ref-6-back"><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> which has had considerable influence on how Silicon Valley-adjacent organizations think about employment. The sports team framing acknowledges that the relationship is time-bounded, that roster changes are normal and expected, and that loyalty operates within that context rather than in spite of it. This is closer to honest than the family framing, and it handles the emotional reality of departure more clearly than either servant leadership or transformational approaches.

The gap is that it says relatively little about what the organization owes the player beyond fair compensation and clear performance expectations. Development, trajectory, and what the player carries forward from the relationship are not really part of the model. The sports team is focused on performance in the present season. What happens to the player's career after they leave the roster is largely outside the frame.

### The Common Absence

Across all of these frameworks, what's missing is a clear articulation of what the manager owes the individual when the relational stakes get high enough.

## Empathetic Transactionalism: The Operating Principle

### The Transactional Foundation

Empathetic transactionalism starts from a premise that most management frameworks treat as either obvious or uncomfortable: the employment relationship is transactional. The manager engages the report's time and skill to accomplish organizational objectives, in exchange for compensation and opportunity. Naming this is not cynical. It is honest, and the honesty is productive because it clarifies what both parties are actually committed to, which is the precondition for a functional implicit contract in Rousseau's sense.

The failure to name this honestly is a frequent source of the dysfunction described at the outset. The manager who frames the relationship as familial is not being warm; they are being inaccurate, and the inaccuracy creates expectations that will eventually be violated by business reality. The manager who acknowledges the transaction while engaging seriously with what it requires of them is in a better position to honor the implicit contract than one who obscures it under more comfortable language.

### The Empathetic Obligation

The empathetic component is not about warmth or friendship, though neither is prohibited. It is about genuinely accounting for the person on the other side of the transaction as someone with a career that extends well beyond the current role, financial pressures, and ambitions that are real and relevant, and a professional trajectory that the manager's decisions will meaningfully affect.

This is not sentimentality. It is an acknowledgment that the thing being exchanged, someone's professional time during a formative or consequential period of their working life, has a value that exceeds its market compensation, and that this creates obligations. Specifically: if a report leaves the organization less marketable than they arrived, if their skills have atrophied, if they have been kept in a contracting lane, if they have been shielded from work that would have developed them, that is a failure of the exchange on the manager's side, assuming explicit and extraordinary monetary compensation. The report gave their time; the manager is obligated to ensure that time was not simply extracted but was, to whatever degree the organizational context allows, an asset to their professional life going forward.

### How ET Differs From Existing Frameworks

ET resembles the sports team model in its rejection of the family framing and its acceptance of time-bounded relationships, but adds a forward-looking obligation the sports team model lacks: the report should leave better positioned for what comes next, an empathetic evaluation of the other person.

It resembles psychological contract theory in its focus on implicit expectations, but provides normative content that Rousseau's framework deliberately withholds.

It differs from transformational leadership in that it does not require authentic belief in a shared mission; a manager can operate from empathetic transactionalism in an organizational context they are uncertain about, in a role they took for practical rather than visionary reasons. The principle does not depend on inspiration. It depends on honesty and on taking the other person's trajectory seriously as a real obligation.

I arrived at this through roughly fifteen years of running a digital marketing agency, making most of the predictable mistakes in sequence. Early on, like most managers without a clear mental model of what I was doing, I imported startup culture's conception of the employment relationship: we are building something together, this is a shared project, you are getting in at the ground floor. I believed this when I said it. What I had not examined was whether it was honest, whether the implicit contract I was creating could actually be honored, and what I owed the people who took me at my word. The answer to that last question took longer to arrive at than it should have.

## ET as a Mental Model, Not a Management System

It is worth being precise about what empathetic transactionalism is and isn't. It is not a framework in the sense that most management frameworks are: a system of practices to be implemented, a set of behaviors to be adopted, a methodology with steps. Frameworks answer the question of what to do in a given situation. ET answers a prior question: what is this relationship, and what does that mean about who I am in it?

That distinction matters because most management dysfunction doesn't originate in a lack of techniques. Managers generally know how to have a difficult conversation or structure a performance review. What they often lack is a coherent conception of the relationship inside which those techniques are being applied, which means the techniques get applied inconsistently, or in service of the wrong ends, or abandoned under pressure when the emotional stakes get high enough.

A mental model for the relationship provides something more durable than a technique. It gives a manager a place to start when a situation doesn't map cleanly onto any framework they've been given: when a report asks for honesty about their prospects, when a friendship has developed to the point where it's creating obligations the professional relationship can't support, when someone is underperforming and the manager isn't sure whether the failure belongs to them or to the report. Techniques run out. A clear sense of what you owe someone, and why, tends not to.

Empathetic transactionalism, held as a mental model, says something specific about each of those situations without scripting the response to any of them. It says: this person is giving you their time during a consequential period of their professional life, the exchange creates real obligations, and your job is to honor those obligations while being honest about what the relationship is and what it isn't. The specific decisions that follow from that orientation (how transparent to be, how much latitude to extend, when the exchange has broken down on one side or the other) require judgment. The mental model is what makes that judgment coherent rather than reactive.
