I've spent my entire career learning from mistakes. Many of my own making, but I've also never had a mentor or been at a company that "did it right," where I learned the ropes. In some ways this has been freeing -- a clean slate, my own rules. On the other hand, I'm acutely aware of my jealousy when I hear a colleague describe how much they learned from someone early on.

This wasn't unusual in the software and digital marketing consulting space in the mid-2000s. Everything was changing, everything was new, the old guard were dinosaurs, and I could write the rules as I saw fit. I fumbled my way to success one mistake at a time. Where I erred the most, and eventually learned the most, was in how I conceived of my relationship to my employees, my team.

## The Setup

In October of 2007, at 26, I started Station Four, a digital marketing agency. I had under a year and a half of professional experience, very little in the way of personal or financial obligations, $5,000 in the bank, and a couple of small Google Ads clients who collectively wouldn't cover my rent. I launched a search-optimized site over a weekend after quitting my job -- somewhat unexpectedly, even to myself. My business partner would have to wait another six months to follow.

We found office space in a commercial furniture showroom, in a loft above the frozen storage of a local chocolatier (the height of luxury!). But it was furnished, and business was good.

Within a year we needed people. We had the clients and the cash but payroll -- reliable, monthly payroll for someone who'd left a steady job to work for us -- felt like an enormous psychological commitment. My first hire was a recent grad working the deli counter at a grocery store. Low stakes on both sides: if it didn't work out in a month, he'd go back to slicing meat. He was excellent. He went full time within weeks.

Eventually we had five people, all in our twenties, two of whom happened to sign the checks.

## The Mythology

This was the era of startup culture -- the foosball table, the stocked fridge, the beers at 4pm that slid into dinner, the unspoken promise that everyone working hard together would eventually share in something big. We weren't a software company, we didn't have stock options to offer, and if I'm being honest I didn't really understand how that part was supposed to work. But we were adjacent to the culture that did. Billion-dollar IPOs were a weekly headline. Being a good web designer felt like a movement and we felt like part of it, even up there above the chocolatier's frozen storage.

So we sold what we had, which was the ground floor. Get in early, grow with us, be part of something. It was a sincere offer, not a cynical one. I believed it when I said it. What I didn't examine was what "growing with us" actually meant -- because if we needed senior people when we scaled, the people I'd hired out of college wouldn't automatically become them. They'd get a new boss. I hadn't thought through what that meant for them, or for the implicit promise I'd made.

Most nights ended with drinks down the street. We were friends where two of the group happened to also be the bosses of the other three. I joined fantasy football leagues, attended birthday parties, became involved in their lives.

## The First Crack

The first real test came with someone we needed to let go. The decision itself was clear -- the role wasn't producing and we were lean enough that this mattered. What I did next I thought was kind. I told her the news wasn't immediate, we could work with her on a transition.

She asked how much time she had. I said something like a couple of months.

Weeks passed. More than a month. I heard through the team that she hadn't started looking. When I checked in, she told me my business partner had said she had as much time as she needed. He said he hadn't. I gave her a final date. She was furious.

What I actually learned from this wasn't about the miscommunication, real or constructed. It was that "we'll work with you on a transition" is not a sentence with a clear meaning, and when people have an incentive to interpret it generously, they will. I thought I was being humane. What I was actually being was vague, and vague is its own kind of unkind.

Later, after a different departure that stung in its own way -- the discovery that someone I'd invested in had spent the tail end of their time here venting in ways that would have surprised me -- I was left sitting with something I didn't have language for yet. At a conference, years later, I heard a speaker describe how each person who left left a chink in the armor. It stays. That landed.

## The Two Wrong Answers

My business partner found his answer in cold distance. Everyone was an employee, dollars in, work out, and if they didn't perform they were replaceable. He didn't mean it -- or didn't fully live it -- but I understood the logic. It's the obvious move when you realize that emotional investment in employees is going to get you hurt. Shut it down. Keep it professional. Don't mistake a business relationship for something else.

I went the other direction. When someone didn't meet expectations, my first question was always whether I'd set them clearly. I took departures personally, each one feeling like a referendum on my vision, my leadership, my judgment. Every separation had the unresolved emotional texture of a contested breakup.

Neither of these works. The cold posture is dishonest about what's actually happening -- you do care, you just refuse to show it, and people can tell. The over-personalization creates obligations that can't be honored and resentments that fester quietly.

## What I Actually Owe You

This is a transaction. I'm hiring you to perform a function, I'll set clear expectations, and I'll hold us both to them. That's not a cold thing to acknowledge -- it's an honest one. Pretending otherwise is how you end up with a "family" framing that benefits the employer and confuses the employee.

But a transaction has two sides. What I owe you isn't a lifetime of employment or a pension or a foosball table. What I owe you is honesty about what this is, a clear sense of what success looks like, and a genuine effort to make your time here useful to your life beyond this company.

You are passing through. That's not a failure -- it's just how careers work, and pretending otherwise is how you end up with people who feel trapped and employers who feel betrayed. The more honest version is: you're here for a period, you'll contribute something real, and when you leave -- which you will -- you should leave for something better. Your time here should be a stepping stone, not just a paycheck, and definitely not a dead end.

That's what I mean by empathetic transactionalism. It's transactional because it's honest about the exchange. It's empathetic because it holds that the person doing the work is a person -- with a career arc, financial pressures, ambitions, and a life that extends well beyond this role -- and that their trajectory is something worth thinking about explicitly.

## What Changed

Toward the end of my time running Station Four, before I sold the agency, I started having this conversation explicitly during onboarding. Not as a warning, not as a disclaimer -- as an orientation. Nothing here lasts forever. We want to be a positive influence on where you're going and that should be a conversation we can have openly.

Since then, in the roles I've taken on the brand side, I've tried to apply the same lens to my direct reports -- what would make them more valuable, what skills are worth developing not just for the current role but for whatever comes next. The people who've responded to that approach have tended to follow me across companies, which tells me something about what people actually want from the professional relationships they're in.

It's not complicated. I don't think it's particularly revolutionary. But I also don't see it practiced very often -- the emotional avoidance, the blurred friend-employee lines, the breakup-adjacent departures -- all of that is still everywhere and often to the detriment of the person over the business.
